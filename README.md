scRNAseq marker gene annotation tools

These are scripts that implement previously developed tools for the purpose of cluster annotation of scRNAseq data using any arbitrary marker gene list.
The purpose of this repo is for personal training and to have visualization methods of the output of these tools.

sc-type.R utilizes the scType algorithm.
cellassign.R utilizes the cellassign algorithm.
